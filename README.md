# Game-Turtle-Crossing
DESCRIPTION: </br>
--> This repository contains the implementation of a simple road crossing game and is developed using Python's Turtle Libray</br>
--> To play this game, download the files from this repo and open main.py in a python development environment.</br>
--> Before running make sure all the libraries mentioned are installed.</br>
</br>
KEY BINDINGS:</br>
- TURTLE MOVES UP: 'w' key (Make sure Caps Lock is off.) </br>
</br>
RULES: </br>
- Ensure that the turtle reaches the other end of the screen without colliding with any of the cars. </br>
- Once the turtle reaches the destination, it will be spawned back to the starting position for the next level and the speed of the cars moving on the road will also increase.</br>
- If the turtle suffers a collision then your game is over. </br>
